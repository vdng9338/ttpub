These are Selenium Tests.  In order to run, you need one of the Selenium tools...I recommend Selenium IDE (Firefox Plug-In).

Once you download and install Selenium IDE:
   1. Open a File Explorer Window on this directory.
   2. Dbl Click one of the BAT files.  It will run a given Test Suite
   3. Alternatively, you can run individual test via the IDE.  Just load the given .html file.

for the Washington State data.
